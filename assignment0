Five data structures/algorithms I found to be interesting and why:
1- Stacks: They are used to impliment function calls so they are very important
2- Arrays: Arrays can hold items of the same exact data type. For exmple an array could hold integers and it would be called an array of integers.
3- Quick sort: It is interesting because it divides arrays, seems simple but it can prove quite useful.
4- Queues: Used to implement queueing systems which is very useful.
5- Linked lists: it is consists of three operations, searching, inserting and deleting.
